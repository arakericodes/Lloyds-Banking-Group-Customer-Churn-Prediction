# Lloyds-Banking-Group-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project predicts customer churn for Lloyds Banking Group using a supervised machine learning approach. The dataset includes customer demographics and behavioral features such as age, gender, income, product usage, and interaction details. After preprocessing the data with encoding techniques (Label, Ordinal, One-Hot) and normalization using StandardScaler, relevant features were selected for training. A Random Forest classifier (bagging-based ensemble method) was used, with hyperparameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV. The model was evaluated using a classification report including precision, recall, and F1 score, achieving approximately 87% accuracy across all metrics.
